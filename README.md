# Image Caption Generator using Deep Learning
Welcome to the Image Caption Generator project! This repository contains the code and resources to build an Image Caption Generator using Deep Learning techniques. With the help of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, this project enables the automatic generation of relevant captions for images.
## Introduction
Have you ever wondered how computers can understand and describe the content of images? With the advancement of Computer Vision and Deep Learning algorithms, it has become possible to build an Image Caption Generator. In this project, we'll walk through the process of creating a model that generates relevant captions for images using Deep Learning techniques.
