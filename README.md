# Image Caption Generator using Deep Learning 🖼️📝
Welcome to the Image Caption Generator project! This repository contains the code and resources to build an Image Caption Generator using Deep Learning techniques. With the help of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, this project enables the automatic generation of relevant captions for images.
## Introduction 🚀
Have you ever wondered how computers can understand and describe the content of images? With the advancement of Computer Vision and Deep Learning algorithms, it has become possible to build an Image Caption Generator. In this project, we'll walk through the process of creating a model that generates relevant captions for images using Deep Learning techniques.
## What is Image Caption Generator? 📸➡️📝
An Image Caption Generator is a system that automatically generates textual descriptions for images. This project utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically CNN and LSTM networks, to achieve this task. The model is trained on a dataset of images paired with corresponding captions, learning to associate images with appropriate descriptions.
## Dataset 📂
The Flickr_8K dataset is used for training the image caption generator model. This dataset consists of images paired with corresponding captions. The images are stored in the 'Flicker8k_Dataset' folder, and the captions are stored in the 'Flickr_8k_text' folder.
## Dependencies 📦
  • Python 3.x  
  • TensorFlow  
  • Keras  
  • NumPy  
  • Matplotlib  
  • NLTK  
## Getting Started 🛠️
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed.
3. Download the Flickr_8K dataset and preprocess it as described in the project documentation.
4. Run the train_caption_generate.ipynb Jupyter notebook to train the image caption generator model.
5. Test the trained model using the provided test images or your own images.

## Future Work
While the current model provides a good starting point, there are several potential improvements that could be made:

• Training on a larger dataset: The model could potentially generate more accurate and diverse captions if trained on a larger dataset.  
• Fine-tuning the model architecture: Adjusting the parameters of the CNN and LSTM could lead to improvements in the quality of the generated captions.  
• Incorporating attention mechanisms: Attention mechanisms could help the model focus on specific parts of the image when generating each word in the caption.
